# Prototype
Oder in which classes are run is IMPORTANT!
Most likely the API class will have to be run fist.
  The API should create a File called MyVoteAPI.ser 
  if the file is not present, server API cannot be initialized
  Basically...
  
  API must be run ONCE in order to initialize the server's API
  
  After that the SERVER can be started and Login will be the next program to run to access the current functions/ GUIs
